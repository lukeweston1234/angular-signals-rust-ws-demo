# Signals WS Demo

Quick demo to see how data binding, WS, work in a Signal context in Angular.

A few problems with resizing the canvas but that's outside the scope of this demo.

Note: This is on Angular 19 which at this time is pre-release. You can find the CLI on NPM under versions.

For development:
```
ng serve
```
