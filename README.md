# SignalsDemo

Note, this project requires the pre-release Angular 19 CLI.

Once that's installed, you can the client like so:

```
ng serve
```

For the backend, install Rust and Cargo.

```
cargo run --release
```

There are some issues with resizing, statefulness, etc. But this is really just a quick demo.
